## Introduction

This quad I made for my best friend who is also into flying but isn't very good at building. I love building drones but didn't have enough savings to buy my own new parts so I asked him if I could build it for him.

## Video

Here is a demo video of the footage captured with the ft 210. It was recorded on a dvr of the fpv analog feed not an hd camera. Thats why the video isn't very quality. This is also the footage I see's though my fpv goggles.
