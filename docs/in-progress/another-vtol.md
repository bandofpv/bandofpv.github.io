## Introduction

After building my first VTOL(LINK), I decided to challenge myself to design and build another but more complex one. My vision is to only use 3 motors like a tricopter. There will be two motors in the front and one in the back. I only have the airframe complete but need access to a laser cutter or 3D printer to create the tilt mechanisms.
