## Introduction

This is a model of the P-51 Mustang which is a very popular WWII american warbird. One of my favorite planes in real life but not to fly my rc version. Its very small and hard to control. 

## Video

I only got it flying well once, but unfortunately, I didn't record it. It crashed and here is a video of my repaired mustang but you will notice how poorly it flys.
