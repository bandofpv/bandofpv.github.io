## Introduction

Made this plane at Flite Fest 2018 in Ohio. I then crashed it in combat the stripped the parts to build it yet again but at home. This plane has capabilities of flying fast, slow, tricks, fpv, and drop bombs. This is by far one of my favorite planes yet. 

## Video

Here is a video of me flying it in combat!
