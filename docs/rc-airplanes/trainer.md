## Introduction

This was my first plane that I was able to learn how to fly. The previous Flyer(LINKK) and Nutball(LINK) was too fast for me to learn. This is also the plane I taught my dad how to fly as well. I've built this plane a total of 4 times either to expirement with different airfoils or center of gravities (CG) and also because some crashes are beyond repair. :)

## Video

Here is a video of me chasing the Ft Trainer (piloted by my dad).
