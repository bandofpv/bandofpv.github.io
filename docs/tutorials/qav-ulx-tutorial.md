## Story:

After building my [qav-r](https://bandofpv.github.io/docs/tutorials/qav-r-tutorial), I wanted to improve my Line of Sight piloting skills. So I decided to build this "basher" quad composed of old parts from my [versacopter](https://bandofpv.github.io/docs/drones/versacopter). That way, I won't be too worried about crashing it if it was brand new.
