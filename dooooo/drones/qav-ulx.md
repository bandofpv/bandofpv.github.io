**Note:** You can find the tutorial for this build **[here](https://andrewbernas.com/docs/tutorials/qav-ulx-tutorial)**

## Introduction

I built this drone right after my [QAV-R](https://bandofpv.github.io/docs/drones/qav-r). This drone was composed of my old parts from my [Versacopter](https://andrewbernas.com/docs/drones/versacopter). It was made with the purpose to be my basher Line of Sight (LoS) quad. Something that I could just practice my LoS skills (not fpv) and I won't care about crashing it. I also just wanted to try out the new frame that GetFPV came out with. You can find the tutorial for this build [here](https://andrewbernas.com/docs/tutorials/qav-ulx-tutorial).
