## Introduction

This is my second drone that I've actually built many times. I built version 1 once and then built two version 2's of the versacopter frame. This was my main frame for a long time until I built my [QAV-R](https://andrewbernas.com/docs/drones/qav-r) so I made many iterations and continued to develop my building skills & techniques.
