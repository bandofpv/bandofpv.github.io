## Introduction

This drone I have made significant progress on. It's capable of scanning an open field using a Search And Rescue (SAR) pattern. It can then detect a human and actually follow the subject if they need to move. This all happens autonomously and will simply tell the "pilot" the gps coordinates of the lost subject when acquired. 

It is pretty much complete. I just need to play around with the search and rescue formations. I also plan to have a demo video and tutorial.
