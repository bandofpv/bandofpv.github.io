## Introduction

This was my first robot I built after getting inspired by a Make: Magazine. I decided to make something pretty simple but still allows me to learn basics of 3D printing and coding Arduinos. 

## Video

Here is a test video of its dancing capabilities. I also programmed it so it can be controlled via a remote controller (allowing  the user to move it forwards, backwards, turn, and perform dance moves).
